## Abstract
Emotional text-to-speech (TTS) technology has achieved significant progress in recent years; however, challenges remain owing to the inherent complexity of emotions and limitations of the available emotional speech datasets and models. Previous studies typically relied on limited emotional speech datasets or required extensive manual annotations, restricting their ability to generalize across different speakers and emotional styles. In this paper, we present EmoSphere++, an emotion-controllable zero-shot TTS model that can control emotional style and intensity to resemble natural human speech. We introduce a novel emotion-adaptive spherical vector that models emotional style and intensity without human annotation. Moreover, we propose a multi-level style encoder that can ensure effective generalization for both seen and unseen speakers. We also introduce additional loss functions to enhance the emotion transfer performance for zero-shot scenarios. We employ a conditional flow matching-based decoder to achieve high-quality and expressive emotional TTS in a few sampling steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

### Vocoder
The BigVGAN 16k checkpoint will be released at a later date. In the meantime, please train using the official BigVGAN implementation or use the official HiFi-GAN checkpoint.

- [[BigVGAN]](https://github.com/NVIDIA/BigVGAN)

------
### 1. Preprocess data
- Modify the config file to fit your environment.
- We use ESD database, which is an emotional speech database that can be downloaded here: https://hltsingapore.github.io/ESD/.

#### a) VAD Analysis
- Steps for emotion-specific centroid extraction with VAD analysis
```bash
sh Analysis.sh
```

#### b) Preprocessing
- Steps for embedding extraction and binary dataset creation (https://huggingface.co/microsoft/wavlm-base-sv, https://huggingface.co/emotion2vec/emotion2vec_plus_large)

Before running the script below, please set the following paths in preprocessing.sh:

- wav_directory: path to your original wav files

- wavlm_save_directory: path to save extracted WavLM embeddings

- emotion2vec_save_directory: path to save Emotion2Vec embeddings

For binary dataset creation, we follow the pipeline from [[NATSpeech]](https://github.com/NATSpeech/NATSpeech).

**Note: You do not need to run MFA (Montreal Forced Aligner) for our setting.**

```bash
sh preprocessing.sh
```
